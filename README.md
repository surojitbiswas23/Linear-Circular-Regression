Title: SEMI-PARAMETRIC LEAST-AREA LINEAR-CIRCULAR REGRESSION THROUGH MOBIUS TRANSFORMATION 


Authors: Surojit Biswas and Buddhananda Banerjee.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel regression model designed for angular response
variables with linear predictors, utilizing a generalized M¨obius transformation to define the
regression curve. By mapping the real axis to the circle, the model effectively captures the
relationship between linear and angular components. A key innovation is the introduction of
an area-based loss function, inspired by the geometry of a curved torus, for efficient parameter estimation. The semi-parametric nature of the model eliminates the need for specific
distributional assumptions about the angular error, enhancing its versatility. Extensive simulation studies, incorporating von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions, highlight the
robustness of the framework. The model’s practical utility is demonstrated through realworld data analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum, showcasing its ability to derive meaningful
insights from complex data structures.
